title: Two Steps for Efficient Publication of Data Visualization
---

Often the protocol for collaboration is to

1. Assign a task
2. Code the task
3. Create a report with visualizations
4. Iterate and Repeat

This may sound lazy, but it is far more work that one may need to do.

### The Goal of Visualization

A visualization is metadata, it is a visual interpretation or avatar of data.  Visualization will often be user-specific and require subsequent iteration to get to the final product.  For example, a researcher will go through many iterations to get to the final published images for a research paper.  This process should be rapid should happen rapidly and parallel to the codes and data.

### Minimum Viable Image

The goal of your visualization is to effectively communicate information about a dataset to a customer or collaborator.  It is going to require iterations.  While making visualizations, it is important to realize that you will need feedback from your market.  This feedback will guide you to a final image.  Matin promotes the idea of rapidly iterating on visualizations to get to the final image faster.

Use the Minimum Viable Image to

* Improve colormaps
* Change plot types
* Improve text content including Annotations and labels
* Effectively communicate data

### Low Cost - Rapid Image Publication

Everyone innovates, everyone has a software stack and suite of preferred tools they like to use.  One of the simplest ways to share an image is to save a screenshot of your dataset. Matin promotes using simple visualizations like this to create MVI's.  

Matin suggests using a public-facing, mounted drive like Dropbox to share the images.  I use Dropbox, so that's what this description will focus on.

A workflow for publishing MVI's

1. Create/Modify a visualization code
2. Run Visualization
3. Save Visualization to Public Dropbox folder
  
   This will create a static link that can be used to share with you market.

4. Broadcast visualization

   Share the new visualization with your market via email, Github issues, or Morse code.

By saving to the Dropbox public folder, your image is automatically public-facing on the web and it is easy to grab a static link to the image that can be shared.  This link may be fragile over the long-term.  A simple delete could render the link dead.   After a sufficient number of iterations,  a final version of the image will need to be made with a reliable permalink.


### Polishing up the final image

Your MVI will go through many iterations.  You will learn how your visualizations are interpreted.  You will learn how communicate effectively.

After the learning process, you will want to publish a final image and share the image in a static place.  The Dropbox links will be fragile on a long enough time line.  Some places to move and prepare a final visualization for are:
